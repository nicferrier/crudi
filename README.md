# CRUDi

CRUDi is an attempt to make a DB based Wiki.

The idea is that a database can express the differences necessary in a
web content system; for example, different tables might represent
different types of content, one table for blog posts, another for
project management tickets. The creation of such content requires
different entry forms, so different display and handling.

Tieing all this together is CRUDi's job.


## Installation

CRUDi is written in crystal-lang right now. We will just make linux
executables and also dockers.

## Usage

I expect there will be web based admin.


## Development

Hack on it with crystal-lang.

```crystal-lang
crystal build src/crudi.cr
```
